Each level claims another ring of land around your capital, adds storage, builders and divisions, and raises every building's level cap and count limits.

    <h4>Performance</h4>
    <p>If the game lags, open ⚙️ Settings and set <b>Render resolution → ⚡ Performance</b>. It has the biggest effect, especially on high-DPI and 4K screens. <b>Graphics quality → 🔷 Low-poly</b> helps too.</p>
    <h4>Graphics quality</h4>
    <p>⚙️ Settings → <b>Graphics quality</b> switches instantly between <b>✨ High</b>, <b>🎨 Classic</b> and <b>🔷 Low-poly</b>. High has realistic procedural textures (grass blades, meadow flowers, forest litter, rock, sand ripples, snow), hill-shading, animated water with sun glints, and drifting cloud shadows. Classic uses flat colours. Low-poly draws every hex as flat-shaded facets and is the fastest option on weak devices.</p>
    <p>Open <b>⚙️ Settings</b> in the top bar to choose how the camera moves: <b>Drag</b>, <b>Keyboard</b> or <b>Both</b>. You can also invert dragging, turn on edge scrolling, change the zoom speed and toggle the minimap. On the World map, click or drag the <b>minimap</b> in the corner to jump anywhere.</p>` },

    <h4>Fog of war & scouting</h4>
    <p>Unexplored land is hidden. <b>Scouts are units you move:</b> Army tab (or Map panel) → <b>Dispatch scouts</b>, then pan the map and <b>click any point</b>. The party walks there, and <b>every hex it passes is revealed</b>, along with a radius around it. Scouts also explore caves and gather <b>intel</b> on kingdoms they pass. Click a party's banner to select it again and send it somewhere new, or order it home. Enemy land may capture scouts. Divisions and fleets also reveal hexes as they move. The Scout Lodge and Cartography extend sight.</p>
    <h4>Expanding your empire</h4>
    <p>Most of the world belongs to nobody, and it is all yours to take. Click any neutral hex → <b>Claim</b>. You pick <b>how big a region to settle</b>: the radius starts at 1 and grows with your Main Hall, up to 6 rings (over a hundred hexes) in one go.</p>
    <p>You do <b>not</b> have to scout first. Settlers push up to <b>3 hexes past your border</b> into land nobody has walked, and they reveal everything they take — so each claim gives you a new frontier to claim from again. Cartography research sends them further. A division standing on neutral land can also <b>🏳️ Annex this land</b> outright, taking the ground around it.</p>
    <p>There is no limit on how much land you can hold; a large realm only makes each new claim a little dearer. <b>Beware:</b> raiders target your <b>undefended</b> hexes, meaning no stationed division and no watchtower or fortress. Undefended land can be pillaged, burned or annexed.</p>` },
  { id: 'territory', icon: '🏘️', title: 'Building on your land', html: `
    <p>The whole world is one map of small hexes. <b>You can build anywhere:</b> on any hex you own, or on any explored unclaimed land, which settles that hex for a small fee. There is <b>no limit</b> on how many of each building you have. The Main Hall only decides which building types are unlocked and how high they can be upgraded. Click an empty hex and pick from <b>Build here</b>, or choose a building in the 🏗️ Build tab and click a hex.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Terrain matters:</b> Lumber Mills produce more in forests, Gold and Iron Mines on hills (and a lot more on a gold vein), Diamond Mines on a gem cave, and Farms on plains or meadows.</li>
      <li>Forests have trees and hills have rocks. Clear them (🪙25, which pays back in lumber or iron) before building, unless the building uses them: lumber mills go straight into forests and mines onto rocky hills.</li>
      <li>Towers, Cannons, Spires and <b>Fortresses</b> fight in every battle within 3 hexes, and they <b>open fire on any hostile army that marches past</b> within range. Each one fights <b>as itself, on its own hex</b>: an Archer Tower looses arrows, a Cannon lobs iron, a Fortress mans two turrets, a Spire throws arcane bolts.</li>
      <li><b>Raiders pick soft targets:</b> buildings with no tower, cannon, spire, fortress or wall nearby are about 4× more likely to be attacked. The Build here panel warns you about unprotected spots.</li>
      <li>Ports and Shipyards need a coastal hex. Fleets can dock at any of your ports.</li>
    </ul>` },
  { id: 'combat', icon: '🛡️', title: 'Combat, raids & defense', html: `
    <ul>
      <li><b>Battles happen right on the map</b> where the armies meet, with no separate screen. The camera jumps there (optional) and a <b>command bar</b> appears at the bottom.</li>
      <li>Each of your divisions is its own group. For each one, choose:
        <ul>${Object.values(FORMATIONS).map((f) => `<li>${f.icon} <b>${f.name}</b>: ${f.desc}</li>`).join('')}</ul>
        <b>Stance:</b> ${Object.values(STANCES).map((st) => `${st.icon} <b>${st.name}</b> (${st.desc.toLowerCase()})`).join('; ')}.
        <br><b>Target priority:</b> nearest, weakest, archers & siege, cavalry, or towers.</li>
      <li>Set each division's default <b>battle plan</b> on its card. The enemy picks formations to counter yours, for example a Square against cavalry or Skirmish against archers.</li>
      <li><b>Guard duty.</b> Press <b>🛡️ Guard</b> on a division's card and it takes the ground it is standing on as its post. From then on, if any enemy sets foot on — or marches at — <b>any hex connected to that post</b>, the division leaves on its own to meet them, and walks back to its post once the land is clear. Several guards share the work: the nearest one answers each call.</li>
      <li><b>Your armies watch the ground around them.</b> Every division guards a ring of ${DETECT_R}–${DETECT_R_IDLE} hexes (wider when standing still, wider again with scouts in the ranks), drawn as a dashed circle on the map. Any enemy army that steps inside it is attacked at once, with no order from you. Enemy armies watch just as carefully, so marching past a hostile force starts a fight.</li>
      <li><b>Coalition battles:</b> every force within one hex of a fight joins it. Your nearby divisions fight together, an enemy army fights beside its capital's garrison and towers, and allied kingdoms fight on your side. A third kingdom hostile to both sides turns it into a <b>3-way battle</b>, and each side only fights the teams it's hostile to. <b>Auto-resolve</b> finishes a fight instantly, and Settings can auto-resolve every battle. With several divisions, the <b>All divisions</b> row sets everyone's formation and stance at once.</li>
      <li><b>You only ever command your own troops.</b> Allied kingdoms fighting beside you run themselves, and a war between an ally and someone else is never handed to you — it is resolved without you unless forces of yours are on that field.</li>
      <li>After a battle, the forces that fought rest for 30 seconds, and beaten armies fall back home. Fights don't chain endlessly.</li>
      <li><b>Counters:</b> Pikemen crush cavalry, Horsemen ride down archers and catapults, Archers shred pikemen, Swordsmen beat archers up close, and Catapults smash towers.</li>
      <li><b>Raids:</b> hostile kingdoms send armies at your <b>weakest land</b>, usually undefended outlying hexes and sometimes the capital. A red ⚠ alert shows the target and ETA, and the target hex pulses red. Intercept the army, station a division on the target, or build a watchtower or fortress. Undefended targets are pillaged without a fight.</li>
      <li><b>Fortifications are formidable.</b> Towers, Cannons, Fortresses and Spires hit and endure about <b>fourteen times</b> harder than they once did — a defended town is a serious undertaking for any army, yours or theirs. Bring <b>Catapults</b> (×10 against stonework), Cannons or Spires if you mean to take one.</li>
      <li><b>Battles are fought on the real landscape.</b> Nothing is faked for the fight: the towers on the field are the buildings that actually stand there, on their real hexes, with their real type and level. Build more of them and more of them fight. <b>Towers shoot at towers too</b> — Cannons and Arcane Spires would rather knock the enemy's stonework down than chase infantry. Walls stiffen your towers; Masonry and Fortification research help too.</li>
      <li><b>Field Medicine</b> saves part of your casualties. War Horns and Healing Salves boost your next battle.</li>
      <li>Winning an assault on a capital loots its treasury and can seize border hexes.</li>
